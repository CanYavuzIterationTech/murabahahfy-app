          ˹Charity is˺ for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah
          to move about in the land ˹for work˺. Those unfamiliar with their
          situation will think they are not in need ˹of charity˺ because they do
          not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg
          people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well
          known to Allah.
